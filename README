Requirements: Node, Visual Studio and SQL Server installed locally

In order to create the database and seed with dummy data:
(1) cd dhtest\backend\WebApi
(2) dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
(3) dotnet ef database update

In order to run the API in debug mode:
(1) Open dhtest\backend\WebApi\WebApi.sln in Visual Studio.
(2) Launch the http profile in the "Go" dropdown. (Docker is also possible but it was not possible to connect to the host DB in the Windows images that I tried. Perhaps Linux would be easier.)
(3) API documentation can be found at http://localhost:5077/swagger/index.html

In order to run the React frontend:
(1) cd dhtest\frontend\product-editor
(2) npm i
(3) npm run dev

Defects to fix:
(1) Formatting of fields (currency, dates).
(2) .NET DateKinds and time zones probably not right.
(3) Add update and delete functionality to the frontend and backend.
(4) Limit the number of bar-chart divisions.
(5) More intelligent validation of data using handlers for the validation framework already provided. In particular design an SKU format.
(6) Authentication and authorisation using a cookie not a token.
(7) Error handling on API calls, and resiliency measures generally.
(8) Split out the migrations into a separate console application.
